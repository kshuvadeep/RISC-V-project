1.Phase 1 : 

  Development of complete risc -v RVI32 support 
  basic interface development  ( LCD , Uart for output and input )
  5 stage pipeline 
  basic verification enviroment development 
  Synthesis in FPGA as well for IC level 

 (Deadline : 15h August )
  breakup 
  
  ML1 : development of a basic working cpu core ( 1 WW -> spill ?) [ 31st july ]
  ML2 : interface development like UART and LCD .(1 WW) [ 6th august ]
  ML3: Piplelining to 5 stage ( 1 WW)  ,syntheis [ 15h august ] 

2. Phase 2 : Linux boot support and booting linux (15th october)
             performance model development 
             tapeout readiness of the core in efabless 

  [ milestones to cover later]

3. Phase 3 : use this core in some kind of application as an embedded application along with MCU or raspberry pi cores . 
  or develop out of order architecture and evaluate performance gains from it .[ october to december ]  

        automatic watering machine , some kind of vision application etc
