The RISC-V architecture defines 32 general-purpose registers, each 32 bits wide in the RV32I (32-bit) base ISA. These registers are named x0 through x31, with each register also having a corresponding ABI (Application Binary Interface) name. Here is a list of the registers along with their ABI names and typical usage:

RISC-V General-Purpose Registers

x0	zero	Hardwired zero
x1	ra	Return address
x2	sp	Stack pointer
x3	gp	Global pointer
x4	tp	Thread pointer
x5	t0	Temporary/Alternate link register
x6	t1	Temporary
x7	t2	Temporary
x8	s0/fp	Saved register/Frame pointer
x9	s1	Saved register
x10	a0	Function argument/Return value
x11	a1	Function argument/Return value
x12	a2	Function argument
x13	a3	Function argument
x14	a4	Function argument
x15	a5	Function argument
x16	a6	Function argument
x17	a7	Function argument

x22	s6	Saved register
x23	s7	Saved register
x24	s8	Saved register
x25	s9	Saved register
x26	s10	Saved register
x27	s11	Saved register
x28	t3	Temporary
x29	t4	Temporary
x30	t5	Temporary
x31	t6	Temporary
Types of Registers and Their Typical Usage
Zero Register (zero):

Description: Always returns zero when read. Writes to this register are ignored.
Usage: Useful for certain types of instructions that require a zero value.
Return Address (ra):

Description: Stores the return address for function calls.
Usage: The jal (jump and link) instruction saves the return address here.
Stack Pointer (sp):

Description: Points to the top of the stack.
Usage: Used for stack management, particularly for local variables and function call frames.
Global Pointer (gp):

Description: Points to the middle of the 2GB global data segment.
Usage: Used to access global variables.
Thread Pointer (tp):

Description: Points to thread-local storage.
Usage: Used in multi-threaded programs to access thread-specific data.
Temporary Registers (t0–t6):

Description: Temporary registers that are not preserved across function calls.
Usage: Used for intermediate computations and temporary storage.
Saved Registers (s0–s11):

Description: Callee-saved registers, which means they must be preserved across function calls.
Usage: Used to save variables that need to be preserved across calls.
Function Arguments/Return Values (a0–a7):

Description: Used to pass arguments to functions and return values from functions.
Usage: The first eight arguments to a function are passed in these registers. a0 and a1 are also used to return values.
Understanding the roles of these registers is crucial for programming in assembly language and for understanding the calling conventions used in RISC-V.
